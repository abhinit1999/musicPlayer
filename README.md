# musicPlayer

This is a simple musicPlyer Application in which one can listen their favourite songs.


# Tools And Technology

In this project i have used simple HTML5 and CSS3.


# Important Topics

 For HTML5 : -> i have used semantic tags so that code can be easily readable and if someone wants to make some changes so they can do it in very less time and effort.
  For CSS : -> I have mainly focused on CSS Box model, CSS grid and CSS flex box properties.
